# A Soft Murmur Keyboard Support

## Start/stop A Soft Murmur using the F5 key on your Mac.

Originally I wanted media key support, but Chrome doesn't support these keys at present. F5 is close though.

## Install Instructions

 - Download the [A Soft Murmur Keys zip file](https://github.com/mikemaccana/aoftmurmurkeys/archive/master.zip) and extract it.
 - Visit [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
 - Click 'Load Unpacked Extension'
 - Select the extracted folder.

Once the extension is installed, you'll need to **restart your browser**. This ensures each tab has the F5 listener running.

## Using Media Play Pause keys instead of F5

This is coming soon, but not yet in Stable Chrome. See https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/commands. I'll add support as soon as it's stable.
