# A Soft Murmur Keyboard Support

## Start/stop A Soft Murmur using the F5 key on your Mac.

Originally I wanted media key support, but Chrome doesn't support these keys at present. F5 is close though.

## Install Instructions

 - Download the [A Soft Murmur Keys zip file](https://github.com/mikemaccana/aoftmurmurkeys/archive/master.zip) and extract it.
 - Visit chrome://extensions/
 - Click 'Load Unpacked Extension'
 - Select the extracted folder.

Once the extension is installed, you'll need to **restart your browser**. This ensures each tab has the F5 listener running.
